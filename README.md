# CSV Benchmark: Ruby vs Go

This project benchmarks CSV file reading performance between Ruby and Go implementations. It measures and compares:

- Reading entire file at once
- Reading line by line
- Duration
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization

## Prerequisites

### Ruby

- Ruby 3.3.5
- Go 1.23

## Usage

### Install dependencies
```bash
bundle install
go mod tidy
```

### Run benchmarks

#### With default dummy CSV file

```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

#### Build custom dummy CSV file

```bash
# ruby tools/csv_file_generator.rb <filename> <rows> <columns>

ruby tools/csv_file_generator.rb custom_test.csv 10000 10
```

#### Run benchmarks with custom CSV file/files

```bash
# ./run_benchmarks.sh <filename1> <filename2> <filename3>

./run_benchmarks.sh custom_test_1.csv custom_test_2.csv custom_test_3.csv
```

### The results
